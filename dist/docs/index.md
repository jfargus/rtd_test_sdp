# Welcome

Welcome to the SDP Qlik Documentation WIki.

## What is this site?

This site is automatically compiled from the contents of the sdp-qlik repo. The site self-maintains using a fully automated pipeline that will update and publish itself whenever any changes are made to our main branch of code. The site also contains articles that detail our best practices, policies, and procedures related to Qlik development (and hopefully more!).

## Who can see it?

This version of our documentation site is visible only to our developers with access to this Gitlab Project, however we have the ability to generate a version of this documentation site that would available for public consumption using the same tools.
